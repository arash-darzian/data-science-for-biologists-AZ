    "# Week 1 - Data handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python modules `pandas` and `numpy` are useful libraries to handle datasets and apply basic operations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the things recapped in week 0 using native Python (e.g. accessing, working with and writing data files, and performing operations on them) can be easily achieved using `pandas` instead. `pandas` offers data structures and operations for manipulating different types of datasets - see [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only cover `pandas` today, however feel free to explore `numpy` in parallel at your own pace e.g. following [this tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) and combining it with continuing to learn `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain familiarity to handle datasets using `pandas`\n",
    "    - Create, read and write data\n",
    "    - Select a subset of variables (columns)\n",
    "    - Filter rows based on their values\n",
    "    - Sort datasets\n",
    "    - Create new columns or modify existing ones\n",
    "    - Summarise and collapse values in one or more columns to a single summary value\n",
    "    - Handle missing data\n",
    "    - Merge datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `pandas` does not come by default as part of the default Python or Jupyter installations. In order to install it in your system, launch the Command prompt just like we saw in week 0 and run the following command: `pip install pandas --user`. Once the command finishes execution, `pandas` will be installed in your system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** if you have any issues installing `pandas`, please get in touch with one of the trainers after the lecture\n",

    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write python commands using pandas to learn how to output tables as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Read the dataset `metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv` and store its summary statistics into a new variable called `metabric_summary`.\n",
    "    - Just like the `.read_csv()` method allows reading data from a file, `pandas` provides a `.to_csv()` method to write `DataFrames` to files. Write your summary statistics object into a file called `metabric_summary.csv`. You can use `help(metabric.to_csv)` to get information on how to use this function.\n",
    "    - Use the help information to modify the previous step so that you can generate a Tab Separated Value (TSV) file instead \n",
    "    - Similarly, explore the method `to_excel()` to output an excel spreadsheet containing summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write python commands to perform basic statistics in the metabric dataset and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Read the dataset `metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv` into a variable e.g. `metabric`.\n",
    "    - Calculate mean tumour size of patients grouped by vital status and tumour stage\n",
    "    - Find the cohort of patients and tumour stage where the average expression of genes TP53 and FOXA1 is the highest\n",
    "    - Do patients with greater tumour size live longer? How about patients with greater tumour stage? How about greater Nottingham_prognostic_index?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Review the section on missing data presented in the lecture. Consulting the [user's guide section dedicated to missing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html) and any other materials as necessary use the functionality provided by pandas to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Which variables (columns) of the metabric dataset have missing data?\n",
    "    - Find the patients ids who have missing tumour size and/or missing mutation count data. Which cohorts do they belong to?\n",
    "    - For the patients identified to have missing tumour size data for each cohort, calculate the average tumour size of the patients with tumour size data available within the same cohort to fill in the missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (Bonus) Try out pandas in a dataset of your own work or from literature/resources you have read/used recently and share with a colleague / rest of the class."
